MNT Core version *3.1.1* is now available from:  <https://github.com/MNTracker/MNT/releases>

This is a new minor version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/MNTracker/MNT/issues>

Non-Mandatory Update
==============

MNT Core v3.1.1 is a non-mandatory update to address bugs and introduce minor enhancements that do not require a network change.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/MNT-Qt (on Mac) or mntd/mnt-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

MNT Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

MNT Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
